### Overview
Interithmetic is an interactive arithmetic game that uses your webcam. The
player answers simple math questions by holding up the number of fingers
corresponding to their answer. The game uses machine learning to classify frames
from the video feed to determine what the player's response is.
See [how to play](#how-to-play) for more.

### Dependencies
The game uses Python, pyglet, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.
Install Information:
- [pyglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyglet/)
- [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)

### How To Play
To navigate the menu, simply use your mouse to click on the option you would like to select. Currently, there are three difficulty settings to choose from: easy, medium, and hard, which have different time limits per question.

Once you have begun a game, you will be given a simple equation with one of the numbers missing. Once you have figured out the answer, hold up the number of fingers corresponding to the number. For example, if you would like to answer with the number "1," hold up your index finger, if "2," hold up your index and middle fingers.
